## Why and How I Built This

ReelRush was created to showcase my skills in building fullstack applications using MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js.

The frontend was built with React.js and Deployed using firebase. I chose firebase because it is super-secure, serverless, it's scales up and down so it follows a microservice architecture. Being hosted on Google's servers eliminates the need for extensive security configuration, so it's basically simplifying the deployment process.

The backend was built with Node.js, Express.js with MongoDB serving as the backbone for the database operations.

## Technology Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Flexbox, CSS Grid
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Deployment:** Render, GH-Pages
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (for deploying frontend)

## Optimizations

This project was built to practice full-stack web development using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. While I could have added features such as authentication, user account creation, video updates, and comprehensive profile management, my primary goal was to attempt integrating a Node.js backend with a React frontend. For more advanced implementations and features, please check out my other projects on GitHub, where I have explored these functionalities in depth.
